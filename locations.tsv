https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Charleston_gibbes_art_gallery.jpg	http://www.gibbesmuseum.org/	Established as the Carolina Art Association in 1858, the museum moved into a new Beaux Arts building at 135 Meeting Street, in the Charleston Historic District, in 1905. The Gibbes houses a premier collection of over 10,000 works of fine art, principally American works, many with a connection to Charleston or the South. The benefactor, James Shoolbred Gibbes, donated $100,000 to the Carolina Arts Association upon his death in 1899 for the "erection of a suitable building for the exhibitions of paintings." Receipt of the money by the city, however, was delayed by a will contest filed by nieces and nephews of Gibbes. Their case was heard in the state court of New York during 1900 and 1901. On December 6, 1901, the New York Supreme Court (the state's trial-level court) issued an opinion declaring that the gift to Charleston was valid. Receiving the money in 1903, the Association hired Frank Pierce Milburn to design the gallery. His design included a Tiffany-style dome, Doric columns and pediment capped windows and doors. Milburn completed the drawings of the building in mid-1903, and a drawing of the proposed building appeared in the Charleston Evening Post on June 5, 1903. Notices were published seeking contractors' bids for the work starting in August 1903. In September 1903, H.T. Zacharias was selected as the contractor and received a contract for $73,370 for the building. Zacharias started work on September 28, 1903, removing the remains of the South Carolina Agricultural Hall which had occupied the lot. Although work on the foundations had begun already, a ceremony was held on December 8, 1903, to lay the cornerstone of the building at the northeast corner. The museum formally opened on April 11, 1905. The collection on display on the opening day included more than 300 pictures, many bronzes, and about 200 miniatures in addition to an "instructive collection" of Japanese prints. At present, the museum is completing a year and a half renovation project through the generosity of over 400 individuals and organizations. The renewal was necessary for a building that is 111 years old, but, more importantly, has provided the opportunity for a new vision for the museum -- where art is created, explored, as well as displayed. Public spaces on the first floor include artist studios, lecture rooms, reception rooms, cafe, and gift shop which opens onto a world class garden suitable for weddings or other festive gatherings. The second floor retains its Beaux Arts elegance, but now will have improved LED lighting and an ingenious display for its famous collection of American art miniatures. Office space on the second and third floors has been reconfigured to provide increased area for new exhibits and a dynamic display of "The Charleston Story" . The Gibbes will now enhance lives through art for the entire diverse community that lives in and visits Charleston. The museum's collections include the work of numerous artists with connections to Charleston; among them are Henrietta Johnston, Mary Roberts, Charles Fraser, William Melton Halsey, and Jeremiah Theus.

http://www.charleston-sc.com/img/content/white-point-02.jpg	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Point_Garden	The Battery is a landmark defensive seawall and promenade in Charleston, South Carolina. Named for a civil-war coastal defense artillery battery at the site, it stretches along the lower shores of the Charleston peninsula, bordered by the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, which meet here to form Charleston harbor. Historically, it has been understood to extend from the beginning of the seawall at the site of the former Omar Shrine Temple (40-44 East Bay Street) to the intersection of what is now Murray Boulevard and King Street. The higher part of the promenade, paralleling East Battery, as the street is known south of Water Street, to the intersection of Murray Boulevard, is known as High Battery. Fort Sumter is visible from the Cooper River side (High Battery) and from the point, as are Castle Pinckney, the World War II aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-10), Fort Moultrie, and Sullivan's Island.As a tourist destination, the Battery is famous for its stately, mainly antebellum homes. Included among the grand houses are the Louis DeSaussure House (1 East Battery), the Roper House (9 East Battery), the William Ravenel House (13 East Battery),the Edmondston-Alston House (21 East Battery), the Charles Drayton House (25 East Battery), the Villa Margherita (4 South Battery), the William Washington House (8 South Battery), the Col. John A.S. Ashe House (26 South Battery), the James Spear House (30 South Battery), and the Col. John Ashe House (32 South Battery). Fort Broughton (ca. 1735) and Fort Wilkins (during the American Revolution and War of 1812) occupied White or Oyster Point, so named because of the piles of bleached oyster shells on the point at the tip of the peninsula. In the 18th century, rocks and heavy materials were used to fortify the shore of the Cooper River on the eastern side of the peninsula. In 1838, this area along the seawall became a promenade. First used as a public park in 1837, the area now known as White Point Garden became a place for artillery during the American Civil War. In popular speech and in a number of unofficial guidebooks and Web sites, The Battery and White Point Garden are sometimes referred to as "Battery Park," but the park and seawall promenade are not regarded by the City of Charleston as a single entity, and the term "Battery Park" is not an official designation. In 2004, a structural report by the City of Charleston showed that the Battery was suffering serious problems and could fail to protect the southeastern portion of the city during hurricanes. In 2012, the City announced that a $3.2 million restoration project would soon commence at the juncture of High Battery (along East Battery) and Low Battery (along Murray Blvd). from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battery_(Charleston) 	The Battery/White Point Gardens	2 Murray Blvd, Charleston, SC 29401	32.769876	-79.930424	parks	32.770509, -79.931948, 32.770004, -79.928675, 32.769354, -79.928997, 32.769584, -79.931846

Finished in 1990, Waterfront Park is a favorite of visitors and locals alike, offering fantastic views of the Charleston harbor. The park covers more than 1,000 feet along the coasts and allows visitors a chance to sit and relax after a long day of shopping and sightseeing. Visitors can watch sailboats cruising the waters and large ships heading in and out of the harbor. Old-fashioned park benches dot the park, and family-sized swings offer a fun way to spend a relaxing afternoon together. A large rectangular lawn provides a great spot for picnics and sunning. Walkways are ideal for strolling, and two large fountains make for fantastic places for children to play, splash and cool off. It is one of the parks that boasts floral displays throughout the year. The fountains light at night, offering a truly spectacular scene along the harbor's waterfront. The park is also centrally located near The Market and other great shopping and sightseeing areas.

Inspired in part by the creation of the British Museum, the Museum was established by the Charleston Library Society on the eve of the American Revolution and its early history was characterized by association with distinguished South Carolinians and scientific figures including Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, Thomas Heyward, Jr., Reverend John Bachman and John J. Audubon.First opened to the public in 1824, the Museum developed prominent collections, which Harvard scientist Louis Aggasiz declared in 1852 to be among the finest in America. Operations were temporarily suspended due to the Civil War, but began again shortly afterward. Progressively acquired since the late 18th century, the Museum's collections now represent the most comprehensive assemblage of South Carolina materials in the nation. Focusing on the South Carolina Lowcountry, modern collecting emphases include natural history, historical material culture and both documentary and photographic resources.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/CharlestonSC_RainbowRow_500px.jpg		“Rainbow Row is the name for a series of thirteen colorful historic houses in Charleston, South Carolina. It represents the longest cluster of Georgian row houses in the United States. The houses are located north of Tradd St. and south of Elliot St. on East Bay Street, that is, 79 to 107 East Bay Street. The name Rainbow Row was coined after the pastel colors they were painted as they were restored in the 1930s and 1940s. It is a popular tourist attraction and is one of the most photographed parts of Charleston. Rainbow Row originally fronted directly on the riverfront of the Cooper River, but that land was subsequently filled in. Merchants constructed commercial buildings with stores on the first (ground) floor and living quarters above. Most of the buildings had no interior access between the first and second floors; exterior stairs were located in the yards behind the houses. In 1778, a fire destroyed much of the neighborhood, and only 95 to 101 East Bay Street were spared. After the Civil War, this area of Charleston devolved into near slum conditions. In the 1920s, Susan Pringle Frost, the founder of the Society for the Preservation of Old Dwellings, now the Preservation Society of Charleston, bought six of the buildings, but she lacked the money to restore them immediately. In 1931, Dorothy Haskell Porcher Legge purchased a section of these, house numbering 99 through 101 East Bay, and began to renovate them. She chose to paint these houses pink based on a colonial Caribbean color scheme. Other owners and future owners followed suit, creating the "rainbow" of pastel colors present today. The coloring of the houses helped keep the houses cool inside as well as give the area its name. By 1945, most of the houses had been restored. Common myths concerning Charleston include variants on the reasons for the paint colors. According to some tales, the houses were painted in the various colors such that the intoxicated sailors coming in from port could remember which houses they were to bunk in. In other versions, the colors of the buildings timestamp from their use as stores; the colors were used so that owners could tell illiterate slaves which building to go to for shopping.

Established in the 1790s, the market stretches for four city blocks from the architecturally-significant Market Hall, which faces Meeting Street, through a continuous series of one-story market sheds, the last of which terminates at East Bay Street. The Market Hall has been described as a building of the "highest architectural design quality." The entire complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Market Hall and Sheds and was further designated a National Historic Landmark.Initially known as the Centre Market, Charleston's City Market was developed as a replacement for the city's Beef Market building (on the site of Charleston's City Hall, 100 Broad Street), which burned in 1796. Market Hall, designed by Charleston architect Edward B. White, was added in the early 1840s. Throughout the 19th century, the market provided a convenient place for area farms and plantations to sell beef and produce, and also acted as a place for locals to gather and socialize. Today, the City Market's vendors sell souvenirs and other items ranging from jewelry to Gullah sweetgrass baskets. Since 1899, the City Market has housed Charleston's Confederate Museum.

It is a single-story square structured, with stuccoed brick walls 32 inches (81 cm) thick, and an original red tile roof that is pyramidal with intersecting gables. Each wall of the building boasts a large arch. The walls get thinner as they reach the top of the arch, changing from three feet thick, near the ground, to just a few inches thick near the top. There are also few doors in the building, so that in the event of an explosion, most of the explosive force would exit through the roof, with the arches acting like funnels. Sand stored in the roof would then smother and put out the fire. Construction of the building was authorized by the Province of Carolina in 1703, during Queen Anne's War, as part of a series of fortifications, but it was not completed until 1713. It was used as a powder magazine until late in the American Revolutionary War, after which it saw a variety of other uses, including as a wine cellar for Gabriel Manigault. The local chapter of the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America acquired the building in 1902, and now operates it as a museum, which includes historic artifacts and displays about the building during the Colonial and American Revolution periods.

One bar regular reported her hair being pulled from behind, and a bar manager recounted hearing an unseen someone’s footsteps crunching leaves in the rear patio area. One former general manager was closing up for the night, and had two of his friends sitting at a nearby table as he did so. All three saw the apparition of a woman wearing black walk through the area, only to disappear. The ornate facade seen from Broad Street was not put up until 1877 during the dark days of Reconstruction, and just before a fanatical storm of intemperance started brewing in the Upstate.  In this era of corruption, South Carolina's governor was an irascible, one- eyed farmer from Clemson named Ben Tillman, nicknamed "Pitchfork Ben". Because of his pro-agrarian outlook for the state, this no-nonsense teetotaler considered "The Holy City" to be a combination of Sodom, Gomorra, and Las Vegas rolled up into one evil booze-soaked burrito. Truth be told, Charleston's history is deeply rooted in many vices! Tillman was determined to end the debaucheries that had been going on in this port city since roughly 1680. He established the state Dispensary, which was basically a State Government controlled monopoly on all alcohol sales. Although the Dispensary Act was put in effect in 1893, it would be a cold day in hell before Charlestonians would pay it any homage. Despite the effort of raiding parties made up of upstate liquor Gestapo, Charlestonians opened up illegal parlors of consumption,	Blind Tiger Pub	38 Broad St, Charleston, SC 29401	32.776928	-79.928768	haunted	32.776772, -79.928595, 32.776685, -79.928581, 32.776684, -79.928891, 32.776765, -79.928939

When Governor Tilman attempted to control alcohol sales in the state, the family converted the pub into a grocery with a small room in the back for illegal alcohol sales. Reports of paranormal activity in the building mostly come from the second and third floors where doors open and close by themselves, voices are heard and there is mysterious rapping on doors. 10, 21 the structure was once a combination grocery store and pub in the downstairs, and the upstairs served as a private residence. There is a spirit within the restaurant today who seems to hate locked doors, often pounding on them or unlocking and opening them. Staff members here were once cleaning up in the second floor dining room. One of the staff members saw someone who they thought was the kitchen manager crouched by one of the walls. He called the manager’s name and got no response. Approaching the figure, the staff member realized that it was someone else and the figure was transparent. Perhaps the figure may be one of people killed in this building during a fire in the 19th century.

She was 25, an old spinster by the day’s standards, and although she was intelligent and attractive, no men would take her for a wife. Heartbroken, she got a church clerk job and lived alone, until she decided to become a prostitute. She still went to church, although the people shunned her and eventually she couldn’t get any clients. She loved storms and would stand high on buildings to watch thunderstorms. One day she was struck by lightning and killed atop this building, then the church, and folks say here her spirit remains. Her apparition has been seen in a red gown, floating across the second floor hall.This plot of ground has known some fascinating history. Formerly the site of a theatre which fell victim to a devastating fire, the 1809 building is the former Planter’s Hotel. Supposedly still haunted by the ghosts of prostitute Nettie Dickerson and actor Junius Booth, the property today has been converted back into a lovely live performance theatre.

It was used as a customhouse and mercantile exchange, and served as the political and cultural center of Charles Towne.The building is steeped in American history.  It was here that the Declaration of Independence was publicly read to South Carolinians.  Here, South Carolina ratified the U.S. Constitution.  Here, George Washington held banquets in the Great Hall.  And here, below the high polish of the hardwood floors, natural light, and Revolution-era beauty, lies a place where prisoners were subject to unspeakable tortures.Several spirits haunt this storied public building, including the ghosts of pirates and patriots. Moans have been heard emanating from the dungeon area where bloodthirsty pirates were once chained, awaiting execution. Staff members have reported hearing eerie footsteps on the upper floors.The Provost Dungeon predates the Old Exchange Building by almost a century.  From 1680 to 1767, Charleston was a walled city to protect the prosperous town from all sorts of invaders–British, Spanish, and pirates.  The Court of Guard building originally sat atop the dungeon, but was demolished, and the remaining seawall lowered in 1767.  When you enter the dungeon, you can still see what’s left of the original wall. Under British control, patriots were chained to the walls of the dungeon alongside pirates and marauders, and left to die from disease, injury, parasites, and rats.  Because it was below the water line, the dungeon sometimes flooded, drowning the captives.  The dead were often left with the living, putrefying in the stifling, humid, stale air. The whole building is allegedly haunted, though the specters upstairs in the Old Exchange are typically far less aggressive.  Because the staff wears Revolution-period clothing, it’s sometimes difficult to tell the living from the dead.  Visitors have reported approaching who they believe is a staff member, only to watch in horror as the “staff’ disappears when addressed.In the dungeon, reports include the usual ghostly occurrences–moans, cries, screams.  Some have seen chains that restrict visitor entry being tugged or pulled.  A few, unlucky visitors have been pushed and even choked.

http://www.pressomatic.com/ccpl/upload/9ebattery.jpeg	http://classicalamericanhomes.org/roper-house/	Roper House, built in 1838 on the recently completed High Battery, commands a sweeping view of the Charleston, South Carolina harbor. The view looks past Fort Sumter, where the Civil War began, and on to the Atlantic Ocean beyond. Built by prominent cotton planter Robert William Roper, the house is an outstanding example of early 19th Century Greek Revival architecture in a city better known for its 18th Century Georgian-style architecture. Roper House is built on a monumental scale, with massive, two-story-high Ionic columns raised above a first floor, arched loggia pedestal base. Ceiling heights are 18 feet on the piano nobile, with tall windows extending to the floor. The piazza, opening off the double parlors, has the finest view in Charleston. It is said that Mr. Roper intended his showcase home to be the first residence seen by visitors approaching Charleston from the sea. The architect of this imposing house is undocumented, but some architectural historians have attributed its design to Karl Friedrich Reichert, a highly regarded German who was working in Charleston at the time on the new Charleston Hotel. This was the city’s largest and most fashionable hotel built in the Greek Revival style. Reichert had studied in Berlin under Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Germany’s preeminent neoclassical architect of the early 19th Century.

This Regency style house was built between 1817 and 1828 by Charles Edmondston, a native of the Shetland lsland who made a fortune as a merchant and wharf-owner. lt was purchased in 1838 by Charles Alston, a wealthy planter, who added features in the Greek Revival style such as the third level of the piazza and the roof parapet with his family coat of arms. The present cast iron balcony replaced an earlier one which was knocked down in the 1886 earthquake. The parapet was also shaken down and was replaced with a minor correction in the heraldry. The interior woodwork is unusual in that it employs ball shapes in place of dentils in entablatures. During the Civil War, the house was occupied in March, 1865 by the Union Maj. Gen. Rufus Saxton. Charles Alston's daughter, Susan Pringle Alston, was the last of his family to live in the house. Her cousin, Judge Henry Augustus Middleton Smith, bought it from her estate in 1922. He moved two Regency style marble mantels from the William Mason Smith House on Meeting Street and installed them in the ground floor rooms. The first two floors are open to the public as a house museum operated by the Historic Charleston Foundation..

Porcher and enlarged and remodeled in the early 1890s by John C. Simonds. Porcher was a cotton broker and after the Civil War was president of the Atlantic Phosphate Company. He was delegate to the South Carolina Secession convention in 1860. Simonds, who purchased the house in 1894, was a native of Abbeville where his father, Andre Simonds, was a banker. The family moved to Charleston in 1865 and the elder Simonds organized the First National Bank. The younger Simonds was educated at Exeter and Yale and succeeded his father as president of the First National Bank. He sold the institution to the Peoples Bank in 1926. A friend later remarked that Simonds retired from banking at an auspicious time. The Simonds family sold the house in 1943. The house is depicted in an 1865 photograph as an ltalianate style dwelling of two stories on a high basement with a pedimented center pavillion and masked piazza. Simonds remodeled the house in the ltalian Renaissance Revival style popular in the 1890s, adding two front piazzas, one square and one semi-circular and a semi-oval wing on the south side of the house. The interior was also remodeled in the Renaissance Revival style, with an abundance of dark oak and mahogany finished woodwork, and two baronial staircases.

Ravenel, who was completely of Huguenot descent and a member of the planting aristocracy, sold his patrimonial acres to become a merchant, and built up one of the city's leading shipping houses. He was also president of the South Carolina Rail Road and was instrumental in developing the Northeastern Rail Road. This house was also the home of his son, Dr. St. Julien Ravenel, the noted scientist who designed and built the Civil War semi-submersible torpedo boat, the Lucy, and was a leader in the development of the phosphate fertilizer after the Civil War. lt was also the home of Dr. Ravenel's wife Harriett Horry Rutledge, who, using the name Mrs. St. Julien Ravenel, authored the book Charleston: The Place and the People, and othe works on local history. ln 1886, the property was purchased by John Ravenel's son-in-law, Elias Horry Frost, president of E.H. Frost & Co., one of the city's leading cotton brokerage houses. He was also head of the Stono Phosphate Company and president of the South Carolina Loan and Trust company. Frost was a noted art collector and owned one of the best libraries in the South. The house was built in the ltalianate style popular in Charleston in the antebellum period. After suffering severe damage in the 1886 earthquake, the house was extensively rebuilt by Frost, who kept the original plan and mass, including the prominent bay on the front, and added features in the Victorian Italianate style fashionable in the 1880s. The property remained in the hands of John Ravenel's descendants until 1953, when it was sold.

It was built in 1892 and early 1893 for Andrew Simonds. The house is of brick with a Portland cement coating according to the plans by the architect, Frederick P. Dinkelberg. The decorative work on the four Corinthian columns and frieze on the front was executed by Morrison Brothers of New York City. The entrance of the house features a large atrium with a fountain. Between 1905 and 1953, the house served as a hotel. During that use, guests included William Howard Taft, Grover Cleveland, and Theodore Roosevelt. Sinclair Lewis was a guest at the hotel, where he completed the manuscript for Main Street. From 1943 to 1946, the United Seaman's Service leased the hotel and rented rooms to seamen and their families. In 1961, James and Mary Wilson bought the house. Their daughter, Mary Wilson, sold it for $3 million to Stephen and Mary Hammond in September 2012.

Mrs. Washington (Cornelia) Roebling purchased the property in 1928, and hired Loutrel Briggs to “restore” the grounds. With Mrs. Roebling’s direction, Briggs’s design was based on remnants of an earlier garden that existed on the site and in the historic tradition of other Charleston gardens. This is thought to be his first garden in Charleston. A significant feature of Briggs’s design was a formal rose garden based on an eighteenth century parterre garden that remained on the grounds. Other features of the design included an enclosed flagstone terrace at the rear of the house, and a long axial walk that extended from the terrace to an historic summerhouse located at the back of the property. In the northeast corner of the grounds, Briggs designed a large formal garden with a central pool and fountain, boxwood bordered beds, along with shrubs, trees and seasonal plantings. The property is privately owned and was named a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

http://www.theclio.com/web/ul/16421.31290.jpg	http://www.charlestonmuseum.org/historic-houses/heyward-washington-house/	Built in 1772, this Georgian-style double house was the town home of Thomas Heyward, Jr., one of four South Carolina signers of the Declaration of Independence. A patriot leader and artillery officer with the South Carolina militia during the American Revolutionary War, Heyward was captured when the British took Charleston in 1780. He was exiled to St. Augustine, Florida, but was exchanged in 1781. The City rented this house for George Washington's use during the President's week-long Charleston stay, in May 1791, and it has traditionally been called the "Heyward-Washington House." Heyward sold the house in 1794 to John F. Grimke, also a Revolutionary War officer and father of Sarah and Angeline Grimke, the famous abolitionists and suffragettes. It was acquired by the museum in 1929, opened the following year as Charleston's first historic house museum, and was recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1978. Here you will see a superb collection of historic Charleston-made furniture including the priceless Holmes Bookcase, considered one of the finest examples of American-made colonial furniture. The property also features the only 1740s kitchen building open to the public in Charleston as well as formal gardens featuring plants commonly used in the South Carolina Lowcountry in the late 18th century.

It is located at Broad and Meeting streets on one of the Four Corners of Law, and represents ecclesiastical law. It was built in the 1750s by order of the South Carolina Assembly. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark.St. Michael's Church was built between 1751 and 1761 at the corner of Broad and Meeting streets on the site of the original wooden church built in 1681 by St. Philip's Church, It had been damaged in a hurricane in 1710 and a new St. Philip's Church was built several blocks away on Church Street. In 1727, what was left of the old wooden church was demolished. It is not known who designed St. Michael's, but it shows the influence of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, designed in the 1720s by James Gibbs. Samuel Cardy was the builder. The walls are of brick that was stuccoed over and painted white. The two-story portico facing Broad Street was the first of its size in colonial America and features Tuscan columns. An organ by John Snetzler was fitted in 1768 but only the case remains; new organ 1994 by Kenneth Jones of Bray, Ireland. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and it was included in the first promulgation of the National Register in 1966. St. Michael's Churchyard, adjacent to the church is the resting place of some famous historical figures, including two signers of the Constitution of the United States. The church houses a clock and change ringing bells dating from colonial times, The clock is the oldest tower clock in North America. The bells are one of four sets (Grace Episcopal, The Cathedral of Saint Luke and Saint Paul and Stella Maris Catholic church) in the Charleston area.

https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/charleston/buildings/uni1.jpg	http://www.charlestonuu.org/	The Unitarian Universalist Church was not originally built by the Unitarians. It was constructed by the Society of Dissenters who needed more worship space. Construction began in 1774 and was nearly complete in 1776 when the Revolutionary War ignited. It is thought that when the British occupied Charleston, they quartered militia and possibly even horses in the building. It was not until after the war ended that the building could be repaired and officially dedicated in 1787. It was unofficially named The Archdale Street Meeting House. For 30 years following the dedication, the Meeting Street and Archdale Street churches operated as a single entity. They shared not only the same two ministers, but the same sermon was delivered each Sunday. Drs. Hollinshead and Keith, co-pastors of the church, preached one sermon in both houses each Sunday, alternating morning and afternoon services. In 1817, one of the ministers and several congregants became Unitarians, moved to the Archdale Street Meeting House, and founded the Second Independent Church in Charleston. The group was rechartered as the Unitarian Church in 1839. Francis D. Lee, a Charleston architect and church member, was hired in 1852 to enlarge and remodel the building. Inspired by the Chapel of Henry VII at Westminster Abbey and St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, Lee completed the project two years later. The fan-vaulted ceiling, nave, and chancel closely resembled their English prototypes; the stained glass windows were considered among the finest in the country. The church may have been the first Gothic architecture built in the United States. The style is referred to as English Perpendicular Gothic Revival.ust 32 years later, the great Charleston earthquake of 1886 struck, shearing off the entire top of the church's tower, including eight paneled buttresses, high pinnacles and medieval-style finials. Masonry from the tower fell through the fan-vaulted ceiling below. A Boston architect by the name of Thomas Silloway came to Charleston after the quake to repair the damage. With funds raised by Unitarian churches throughout the country, he restored the interior to Francis Lee's original design. The tower, however, was rebuilt in a slightly less elaborate form with the pinnacles and parapet lowered and simplified. This was solely to increase structural stability in the event another earthquake struck Charleston. More than one hundred years passed before Charleston faced another natural disaster. Hurricane Hugo struck the Holy City in 1989, causing massive damage in the historic district. The roof of the Unitarian Church was lost during this devastating storm. Following Hugo, the church was repaired to the specifications set by Thomas Silloway and remains nearly unchanged to this day.

http://www.huguenot-church.org/uploads/1/0/4/2/10426601/_5601331.jpg	http://www.huguenot-church.org/	The Huguenot, or French Protestant movement, was a major force contributing to the evolution  of the European Protestant Revolution. The harsh persecution of the Protestants by the French Catholic Court resulted in their migration to foreign lands in Europe, South Africa and the Americas.  By the late 17th century, Huguenots had settled in New York, Philadelphia, and other Eastern coastal areas. These early groups were greatly augmented when Louis XIV caused the Edict of Nantes to be revoked in 1685, thereby divesting French Protestants of all religious and political prerogatives. The English were happy to encourage these refugees to settle in the colonies, most of whom were representative of France’s prosperous merchant and professional classes.  In April of 1680 the ship Richmond arrived in Charleston with 45 French Protestants (Huguenots) aboard. More refugees followed, and in 1687, a church was built on what is now the corner of Church St. and Queen St. in downtown Charleston. About four hundred and fifty Huguenots had settled in the Low Country of South Carolina by 1700.  The original church was destroyed in 1796 in an attempt to stop the spread of a fire, which had burned much of the surrounding area. The replacement for the original building was completed in 1800 and dismantled in 1844 to make way for the present Gothic Revival edifice, designed by Edward Brickell White and dedicated in 1845. The church was damaged by shellfire during the long bombardment of downtown in the War Between the States and was nearly demolished in the severe earthquake of 1886.  When the building was completed in 1845, the church also purchased and installed a tracker organ carved in the style and shape of a Gothic chapel. Its keys are connected with the pipe valves by a wooden “tracker’ or mechanical linkage which responds to the organists touch faster than any modern mechanism allows. Its tone is similar to the Baroque organs for which Bach and Handel composed. It was built by the leading American organ builder of the first half of the nineteenth century, Henry Erben. After the fall of Charleston in 1865, federal soldiers dismantled the organ and were loading it on a New York bound ship when the pleas of the organist, Mr. T.P. O’Neale, and some influential friends saved it.  Today, the services are no longer in French except once a year, and worshipers no longer arrive in boats as they did when this was known as “The Church of the Tides”. However the church is alive and well and growing in both membership and program. Attendance is at an all time high. The church boasts a varied congregation made up of young single people, traditional families with children as well as mid-life and senior members. Although there are members who are descendants of French Huguenot families, being of Huguenot descent is not a requirement for membership.  The Huguenot Church of Charleston is independent and is not affiliated with any governing church body. We see this as an advantage in a time of intradenominational strife. The church shares many historical links to the Presbyterian Church (Church of Scotland), the Dutch Reformed, and Lutheran Church by virtue of its early leadership under John Calvin. Calvin’s Institutes of the Christian Religion published in 1536 form the historic basis for the formation of these “Calvinist” denominations. The French Protestant (Huguenot) Church is perhaps least known among them. This may be attributed at least in part to the tendency of Huguenot immigrants in the American Colonies to assimilate into their communities and their intermarriage into families who were practicing Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, etc. So, the Huguenot Church of Charleston is unique. It is a living remnant and reminder of the Huguenot experience here in South Carolina.  Worshipers of all Christian backgrounds are welcome, and the church attracts a large number of visitors owing to Charleston’s vibrant tourism. In addition, the Sunday worship is followed by a light meal known in the church as the collation. Wine is served in the French tradition.  The collation remains a firm commitment of the church to its tradition of fellowship and welcoming hospitality for which Huguenots are known.

https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-zaQ_zW4ANwM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB0/Th5mHK_BbTw/s0-c-k-no-ns/photo.jpg	http://www.circularchurch.org/	he Circular Congregational Church is a historic church at 150 Meeting Street in Charleston, South Carolina, USA, used by a congregation established in 1681. Its parish house, the Parish House of the Circular Congregational Church, is a highly significant Greek Revival architectural work by Robert Mills, and is recognized as a U.S. National Historic Landmark.The congregation was co-founded with Charles Towne, 1680–1685, by the English Congregationalists, Scots Presbyterians, and French Huguenots of the original settlement. These "dissenters" erected a Meeting House in the northwest corner of the walled city. The present sanctuary occupies that exact site. The street leading to it was called "Meeting House Street," later shortened to Meeting Street. The earliest records of the church were lost when a hurricane swept them from the manse, located at White Point (the Battery), in 1713. During the colonial period, this unusual church had no official name, but "suffered itself to be called either Presbyterian, Congregational, or Independent: sometimes by one of the names, sometimes by two of them, and at other times by all three. We do not find that this church is either Presbyterian, Congregational, or Independent, but somewhat distinct and singular from them all." Many of the early ministers hailed from Scotland, England, Wales, and New England. The "old White Meeting House" was enlarged in 1732, only a year after 12 Scots families moved down the street to start the First (Scots) Presbyterian Church with a stricter Presbyterian government and doctrine. While many Presbyterians remained, the policy of this church "was not so much to define exactly a particular mode of their discipline, and to bind their hands up to any one stiff form adopted either by Presbyterians, Congregationalists, or Independents, as to be upon a broad dissenting bottom, and to leave ourselves as free as possible from any foreign shackles, that no moderate persons of either denomination might be afraid to join them.” Shaped by its independent mind and goaded by a colonial government that treated “dissenters” (non-Anglicans) with contempt, the church became a greenhouse for revolutionary sentiment in the colony. Prominent members of the Meeting House, and its distinguished minister, William Tennent (1772–1777), were frequently heard speaking for political and religious freedom. Tennent took his life in his hands when he made a wide tour of the Carolina back-country in 1775 to gain subscribers for the cause of independence. The Archdale Street Meeting House separated in 1817 as the Second Independent Church, and later it adopted the name Unitarian. The congregation of Circular Church remained trinitarian under the pastoral leadership of the Rev. Benjamin Morgan Palmer (1813–1835). Noteworthy is the fact that Palmer was a special son of this church, born in Philadelphia just two weeks after his parents had been driven into exile there in 1781. When the British captured Charleston in 1780, this church was bitterly rewarded for its love of freedom by the illegal exile of 38 heads of families to St. Augustine (in Spanish territory) and then to Philadelphia. Their families were left destitute in an occupied city. The Meeting House, vacant since the cannonball episode, was used as a British hospital and left a shell. In 1782 the church-in-exile held a congregational meeting in Philadelphia where they made arrangements to call a minister to Charleston “as soon as may be feasible.” (Tennent had died in 1777.) Members remaining in Charleston began the week of British evacuation to rebuild the Meeting House. By 1787, the congregation had built a second meeting house on Archdale Street to accommodate their growing number. For 25 years, Drs. Hollinshead and Keith, co-pastors of the church, preached one sermon in both houses each Sunday, alternating morning and afternoon services. The independent or Circular Church joined the Congregational Association in 1882, the United Church of Christ (its successor) in 1954, and Atlantic Presbytery of the United Presbyterian Church in 1968. It is one of the few congregation in the South that expresses its ecumenical commitment by belonging to two denominations, the U.C.C. and the Presbyterian Church. The church follows Jesus Christ in the radical way of progressive Christianity. Followers believe the Bible is truthful but not literal, that God is a living Presence but not a dominating white man in the sky, that Jesus is a person of the Spirit and of saving wisdom but not a sacrifice to an offended God. Circular Church is aware of the needs of people on the margins of society. The church has founded the city’s first marriage and family counseling center, Charleston’s crisis intervention service (Hotline), Hospice of Charleston, and the Elder Shelter. Space and leadership have been provided to the Charleston Interfaith Crisis Ministry, Amnesty International, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Charleston PEACE, and other community organizations. The congregation, international and multiracial, has been served for 15 years by part-time clergy, a reminder to the congregation that every member is called to priesthood and ministry. Visitors are welcome both to explore the grounds and to explore the faith in worship, ministry, and life in community. They are one of the few congregation in the South that expresses its ecumenical commitment by belonging to two denominations, the United Church of Christ and the Presbyterian Church.

http://www.sciway.net/sc-photos/wp-content/uploads/st-john-the-baptist.jpg	http://charlestoncathedral.com/	The Cathedral of St. John the Baptist is a magnificent structure, a grand monument to the faith of thousands – past and present – and a wonderful house of prayer for all peoples. But the road to today was a long one; negotiated only through the arduous sacrifice of generations of the Faithful. On May 3, 1821, Bishop John England, the first Bishop of Charleston, purchased property on the northeast corner of Broad and Friend (now Legare) as a site for the cathedral. A “dwelling house” was on the lot, and on December 30, 1821, Bishop England blessed it as a temporary chapel for the congregation, and it was named in honor of St. Finbar, the patron saint of Cork, Ireland. The cornerstone was laid for the first cathedral at the present site on July 30, 1850. Called the Cathedral of St. John & St. Finbar, it was consecrated on April 6, 1854. This antebellum cathedral was able to seat 1,200 people and cost $103,000 to build. On December 11, 1861, a fire broke out in a factory on Hasell Street, destroying much of Charleston including the cathedral. Everything was lost. Fund-raising for a new cathedral continued for the next 45 years, and finally the cornerstone for the present Cathedral of St. John the Baptist was laid in January of 1890. The Gothic architecture calls for a spire, but due to lack of funds, it was never built. The lower church includes a crypt where Bishop England (with his sister, Joanna) and four other Charleston bishops are buried. The present church was built on the foundation of the 1854 cathedral. The structure is of Connecticut tool-chiseled brownstone. Over each entrance are unique stained glass windows including the Papal coat of arms and the seal of the state of South Carolina. The pews are of carved Flemish oak, and the three original altars are of white Vermont marble. In the nave are 14 large two-light windows, representing the Life of Christ from His Nativity to the Ascension. Above the high altar is a five-light window copied from Leonardo DaVinci’s “Last Supper.” The rose window above it is the Baptism of Jesus by St. John the Baptist. In the clerestory of the sanctuary are windows honoring the four evangelists. In preparation for the 50th anniversary of the cathedral in 1957, extensive repairs were made to the building. In the winter of 1966-67. For the 75th anniversary of the cathedral in 1982, renovations were initiated by Bishop Ernest L. Unterkoefler. In 1991, Bishop David B. Thompson commissioned the present permanent altar of celebration. A new bishop’s chair was situated to the left of the altar, and all of the furnishings in the altar area were commissioned during this renovation. The side walls were newly plastered and the entire church was painted in 1995. The color scheme and the gold-leafing highlight the Gothic architecture. A 25-rank French Romantic pipe organ, Bedient Opus22, was purchased from the Episcopal Christ Church Cathedral in Louisville, Ky. Early in the new millennium, a committee was formed to guide an appeal for funds to restore the stained glass and the exterior stone work. Eventually, the project included the addition of the steeple and three bells, to proclaim the presence of God in the community. The Cathedral appeal was called ‘Forward with Faith’. At the same time, Most Reverend Robert Baker, initiated a diocesan wide appeal named ‘Our Heritage, Our Hope’, which among other things, pledged half the cost of the additions and renovations. Now, the fruits of the generosity of the Catholics of South Carolina, the Cathedral parishioners, and visitors to the Cathedral are witnessed in the magnificent new spire, 103 years later than planned, no doubt, but a superb addition to the Catholic heritage of the state, and Charleston herself. Thus continues the history of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist, the “mother church” of the Catholic Diocese of Charleston.
